title: Formal Course Description
---

This course will cover the latest advances in Reinforcement Learning and Imitation learning.
<br />

This is a fast developing research field, and the official textbook covers only about one fourth of the course material. The rest will be taught from recent research papers.

The course brings together many disciplines of Artificial Intelligence to show how to develop intelligent agents that can learn to sense the world and learn to act imitating others or maximizing sparse rewards. Particular focus will be given in  incorporating visual sensory input and learning suitable visual state representations.
<br />

### Key Topics 
* Imitation learning (behavioral cloning, inverse RL, visual imitation, generative adversarial imitation learning, causality inference for imitation learning)
* State representations (CNNs, graph neural nets, RNNs, geometry-aware RNNs)
* Model-free reinforcement learning (actor-critic methods, max entropy RL, multigoal RL)
* Model-based reinforcement learning (Monte Carlo Tree Search, deep model learning, Gaussian processes, intuitive Physics, model predictive control, global/local models, LQR)
* Exploration (Thompson sampling, bayesian RL, curiosity,intrinsic motivation)  
* Transfer Learning (Sim2REAL, Multi-task RL, self-supervision)
<br />

### Course Goals
Upon completion of the course students should be able to:
* Implement and experiment with existing state-of-the-art methods for learning behavioral policies supervised by reinforcement, demonstrations and/or intrinsic curiosity.
* Evaluate the sample complexity, generalization and generality of these algorithms.
* Understand research papers in the field of robotic learning.
* Try out ideas/extensions on existing methods. 
<br />

### Prerequisite Knowledge
Students should have a solid understanding of the following areas:
* **Algorithms**: e.g., What problem does Dijkstra's algorithm solve?
* **Probability**: e.g., What is Bayes rule? How do you normalize a distribution?
* **Computer vision**: convolutional networks, object detection architectures, LSTMs, attention models 
* **Deep Learning**: familiarity  with TensorFlow and/or Pytorch. 
* **Matrix Calculus**: e.g., What are derivatives of matrix-matrix and matrix-vector products? What is the multivariate chain rule?
* **Programming**: e.g., What are classes and inheritance? How do you structure read data from files? How do you plot figures to visualize results?
* **Numerical programming**: e.g., How would you perform an elementwise product instead of an inner product? How do you invert a matrix? How do you broadcast operations from a low dimensional tensor onto a multi-dimensional tensor?
