In recent years, the combination of deep learning with reinforcement learning has led to great advancements in self-driving car technology, machines that can play video games at superhuman levels; and AlphaGo -- a program able to play the strategy game of Go at superhuman levels.  

This graduate-level course brings together many disciplines of Artificial Intelligence (including deep Learning and reinforcement Learning) to show how to develop intelligent agents, that can learn to sense the world and learn to act imitating others or maximizing sparse rewards.  

You will gain a strong foundation for both applying reinforcement learning to complex problems and addressing core research topics in the field. Particular focus will be given on incorporating visual sensory input and learning suitable visual state representations.
